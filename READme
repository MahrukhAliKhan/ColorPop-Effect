# Color-Pop Effect Using OpenCV library

In this repository I have implemented the colorpop effect using OpenCV library in python. This code will convert the whole image to grayscale except colors like Red, Blue and Yellow. You can change the hue settings according as per your choice. 

Follow the steps to run this repository:

#### Cloning the Main Repository :
```
git clone -b ColorPop-Effect https://github.com/MahrukhAliKhan/ColorPop-Effect.git
```

#### Navigate to Main Repository :
```
cd ColorPop-Effect
```

#### Creating Virtual Enviromrnt :
```
sudo apt install python3.9-venv
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
#### Installing requirements and dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Change hue setting for the desired color:
```
For Red color:
#set the bounds for the red hue
lower_red = np.array([160,100,50])
upper_red = np.array([180,255,255])


For Blue color:
# Set the bounds for the blue hue
lower_blue = np.array([100, 100, 50])
upper_blue = np.array([140, 255, 255])


For Yellow color:
# Set the bounds for the yellow hue
lower_yellow = np.array([20, 100, 100])
upper_yellow = np.array([40, 255, 255])

```

#### Running colorpop.py file :
```
python3.9 colorpop.py
```
